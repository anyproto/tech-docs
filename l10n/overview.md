# Projet overview

We have started accepting translations for Anytype Apps. 

The project is managed via Crowdin platform:
- [Anytype Desktop](https://crowdin.com/project/anytype-desktop)
- [Anytype Mobile](https://crowdin.com/project/anytype-mobile)

## Supported languages
Currently, the app does not support right-to-left languages, so we didn't make them available for translation.

If your language is not listed on Crowdin yet, please leave a comment in the [Contributors Community](https://github.com/orgs/anyproto/discussions/93), and we will swiftly add it.
