# Projet overview

We have started accepting translations for Anytype Desktop. 

The project is managed via [Crowdin platform](https://crowdin.com/project/anytype-desktop).

It is also possible to contribute your translations directly to [`l10n-anytype-ts`](https://github.com/anyproto/l10n-anytype-ts) repository.

## Supported languages
Currently, the app does not support right-to-left languages, so we didn't make them available for translation.

If your language is not listed on Crowdin yet, please leave a comment in the [Contributors Community](https://github.com/orgs/anyproto/discussions/45), and we will swiftly add it.

## Next steps
1. Launching localization for Anytype Mobile
2. Optimizing apps for RTL languages and make translations to them available.
