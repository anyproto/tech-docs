# Translation policy

## Brand Voice

ANY communicates in a thoughtful, transparent, and poetic manner. Our goal is to make our users (and potential users) feel comfortable and cared for, while providing nuggets of inspiration and big vision in the meantime. 

## Tone
Preferred tone of voice is informal. 

For languages with formal and informal address it's better to stick with informal (i.e., 'du' in German) unless the language has clear conventions about product copy (i.e., French tends to use formal forms).

## Gender-specific translations
A lot of languages are gender-specific, so phrases like "I've lost my Recovery Phrase" can't be translated correctly without knowing the user's gender.

For such cases, try to change these phrases to be gender-neutral. For example, "I've lost my Recovery Phrase" can be translated as "My Recovery Phrase is lost" or "I have no Recovery Phrase." Find a representation that sounds natural in your language.

In some cases, removing a pronoun will also help. For example, "I got it!" can be changed to "Got it!" to become gender-neutral in some languages.

## Dates 
Currently, the Anytype app doesn't support localization for date references. Now, dates should always be formatted in the en-US locale (YYYY-MM-DD, @three days ago, @last month).

## Pluralization
A lot of languages have more than two plural forms for nouns. Currently, the Anytype app doesn't support complex pluralization. Please find a way to better address this problem in your language, as proper pluralization is not supported yet.
