## Brand Voice

ANY communicates in a thoughtful, transparent, and poetic manner. Our goal is to make our users (and potential users) feel comfortable and cared for, while providing nuggets of inspiration and big vision in the meantime. 

## Tone
Preferred tone of voice is informal. 

For languages with formal and informal address it's better to stick with informal (i.e., 'du' in German) unless the language has clear conventions about product copy (i.e., French tends to use formal forms).
